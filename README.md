# Tor Snowflake + balena

**Snowflake** is a system that allows people from all over the world to access censored websites and applications.
Similar to how VPNs assist users in getting around Internet censorship, **Snowflake** helps you avoid being noticed
by Internet censors by making your Internet activity appear as though you're using the Internet for a regular video or voice call.
